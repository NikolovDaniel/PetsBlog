## Project Introduction

**Pets Blog** is a <b>Web application</b> which people can use to share information and pictures about their pets. The project was made 
to mimick some kind of a social media for pets in my internship. That way people could share everything they want about their pet, without spamming
group chats.

## General Info
The application is Mobile, Tablet, Desktop Responsive. 
<br>
Everything which has functionality works with Pet ID, Owner ID and "API Key". 
  * The Pet and Owner ID are provided when creating the Pet.
  * API Key can be received by contacting me. That is to ensure that there is no spam, because space is limited.

* Pet Biography

The application provides functionality for the user such as:
* Creating one or few Pets.
